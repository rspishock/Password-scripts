# Password-scripts

A Perl script which will provide the user with a randomly generated password based off of user specified criteria.
User will provide the script with the length of password and character criteria (e.g. special characters, numbers, capital/lower case).  Once the password has been generated, the user will have the option of having the password printed out to the console or exported to a text file.

This is the sixth generation of this script.  Each geneartion built on previous generations by adding functionality that previous versions did not support, most notably; complexity and file I/O.

## What I learned
In the creation of this script, I utilized random character generation, functions, as well as file interaction.
